## 1.1.4

This release includes bug fixes and additions for the layout class.

Fixes:
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Revised the inject_modal() method to use Bootstrap 5 markup for the close button by default. A new argument can be passed as false to use Bootstrap 4 markup if needed.
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Fixed a bug with the inject_modal() method, in which custom CSS classes passed to the method were ignored.

Additions:
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Added a new method, format_headline(), which escapes html in a string, then runs the string through the format_tags() method.
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Added a new method to replace the existing inject_modal() method. This new method, inject_bs_modal(), accepts arguments as an array and uses WordPress' standardized method to merge passed args with an array of defaults. This new method also adds support for using the small and extra-large modal sizes, and includes an argument for hiding the modal title. The inject_modal() modal will continue to be included for backwards compatability.
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Added a new method, get_bg_inline_style(), for conditionally building an inline style tag for a background image, based on whether the passed attachment ID evaluates as true.
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Added a new method, odd_or_even(), which returns a distinct value based on whether a passed number is odd or even. 'odd' or 'even' is returned by default, but custom values can be passed to the method if needed.

---

## 1.1.3

This release includes several new methods and enhancements for the Method_Layout class.

Changes:
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Added a new argument to the array_to_p() method for keeping a provided seperator visible.
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Added a new method, get_headline_from_option(), for building a headline from a retrieved theme option.
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Added a new method, get_content_from_option(), for building filtered content from a retrieved theme option.
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Added a new method, get_loaded_content(), for building filtered content from a loaded meta key.
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Added a new method, get_content(), for building filtered content from a meta key belonging to the current post ID.
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Reformated the file to be more readable and structured.

Changes:
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Reformatted the file to better fall in line with the WordPress Core coding standard.
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Fixed a bug with the output of the inject_modal() method. The correct CSS ID is now applied to the modal headline.
* ( class-method-layout.php ) Output for the array_to_ul() and array_to_p() methods is now passed through the format_tags() method.
* ( class-method-layout.php ) A class can now be added to the ul tag generated by the array_to_ul() method.
* ( class-method-layout.php ) A visually-hidden seperator can now be included before each line break in the output of the array_to_p() method.

## 1.1.1

Changes:
* Fixed an issue with the core layout class that caused a fatal error (attributes were private and are now protected)
* Updated Bootstrap to v5.0.0-beta2 and moved variable customization into the theme.scss file. This makes it possible to upgrade Bootstrap without having to worry about any overrides being lost.
* Bootstrap js and scss files can now be found under inc/bootstrap
* Renamed the theme layout class.

---

## 1.1.0

This release implements a new abstract layout class, called Method_Layout, which the theme layout class now extends. This makes it possible to upgrade the core layout class as new versions are released, as the utility functions are now seperated from theme-specific code. Going forward, releases will include the option to download only the layout class.

Changes:
* ( new file: class-method-layout.php ) Added the new parent layout class
* ( functions.php ) Fixed a reference to an undeclared variable in the check_key() function.
* ( functions.php ) Rewrote the theme layout class to extend the new Method_Layout class.

---

## 1.0.15

Changes:
* ( functions.php ) Fixed an issue with the unload_meta method in the layout class (an ID does not need to be passed to the method)

---

## 1.0.14

Changes:
* Moved bundled JS scripts into the inc/ directory for consistency.
* Upgraded jarallax to 1.12.4 and removed the depracated jarallax-element.js file.
* Upgraded Bootstrap to v4.5.3.
* Recompiled scripts.min.js and theme.min.css.

---

## 1.0.13

Changes:
* ( functions.php ) Added a new method to the layout class, get_headline(), to provide a uniform method for handeling fields that support format tags. This also allows for cleaner code, as the method handles logic for checking if a meta key is empty, falling back to an optionally provided fallback, and then not rendering anything. While fallback strings are not processed in any way, metakeys are passed through esc_html() and then the format_tags method if not empty. Example usage: $this->get_headline( 'my_meta_key', '<h2>', '</h2>', 'Fallback' )
* ( functions.php ) Added a new function, method_get_tags_badge(), that returns HTML for a "Tags Supported" badge. This badge can be inserted into CMB2 field descriptions for fields that will be passed through the format_tags() method of the layout class. Clicking the badge will open a dialog listing available tags. If you add additional tags to the format_tags() method, you should update the dialog's text to detail them so that content editors know that they are available and what they do.
* ( assets/css/admin-styles.css ) Added an admin CSS file, which currently contains styles for the "Tags Supported" badge (.method-tags-opener)
* ( functions.php ) Added a new function, method_admin_scripts(), that registers admin-styles.css, the jquery ui dialog plugin, and styles for the current version of WordPress-bundled jquery ui for the admin area of the site via admin_enqueue_scripts
* ( functions.php ) Added a new function, method_admin_footer_function(), that injects js and html for the format tags dialog into the admin footer via admin_footer
* ( functions.php ) Added support for inserting em tags to strings processed with the format_tags method.
* ( functions.php ) Added new methods to the layout class for loading a second set of post meta, retrieving loaded meta in a similiar fashion to the get_meta() method, and unloading the meta. This was added for easier handling of meta in archive layout components. ( load_meta(), get_loaded_meta(), get_serialized_loaded_meta(), unload_meta() )
* ( functions.php ) Added a new method to the layout classes, get_loaded_headline(), for indentical headline processing, but with loaded meta.

---

## 1.0.12

Changes:
* ( functions.php ) Added a new function, method_str_replace_assoc(), to find/replace strings using values from an associative array.
* ( functions.php ) Modified markup for the layout class default 'active' component to look like the 404 template.
* ( functions.php ) Added a new function to the layout class, format_tags(), for replacing format tags with html markup.
* ( theme.scss ) Changed body.error404 to .error404 so the contained styles could be reused on non-error404 pages.

---

## 1.0.11

Changes:
* ( assets/images/login-bg.jpg ) Updated the background image for the custom login page.
* ( assets/images/login-logo.* ) Updated the theme logo for the custom login page and changed it's format to SVG.

* ( functions.php ) Removed granim from the custom login page, and removed it's required extra markup.
