## 1.1.0

This release implements a new abstract layout class, called Method_Layout, which the theme layout class now extends. This makes it possible to upgrade the core layout class as new versions are released, as the utility functions are now seperated from theme-specific code. Going forward, releases will include the option to download only the layout class.

Changes:
* ( new file: class-method-layout.php ) Added the new parent layout class
* ( functions.php ) Fixed a reference to an undeclared variable in the check_key() function.
* ( functions.php ) Rewrote the theme layout class to extend the new Method_Layout class.

---

## 1.0.15

Changes:
* ( functions.php ) Fixed an issue with the unload_meta method in the layout class (an ID does not need to be passed to the method)

---

## 1.0.14

Changes:
* Moved bundled JS scripts into the inc/ directory for consistency.
* Upgraded jarallax to 1.12.4 and removed the depracated jarallax-element.js file.
* Upgraded Bootstrap to v4.5.3.
* Recompiled scripts.min.js and theme.min.css.

---

## 1.0.13

Changes:
* ( functions.php ) Added a new method to the layout class, get_headline(), to provide a uniform method for handeling fields that support format tags. This also allows for cleaner code, as the method handles logic for checking if a meta key is empty, falling back to an optionally provided fallback, and then not rendering anything. While fallback strings are not processed in any way, metakeys are passed through esc_html() and then the format_tags method if not empty. Example usage: $this->get_headline( 'my_meta_key', '<h2>', '</h2>', 'Fallback' )
* ( functions.php ) Added a new function, method_get_tags_badge(), that returns HTML for a "Tags Supported" badge. This badge can be inserted into CMB2 field descriptions for fields that will be passed through the format_tags() method of the layout class. Clicking the badge will open a dialog listing available tags. If you add additional tags to the format_tags() method, you should update the dialog's text to detail them so that content editors know that they are available and what they do.
* ( assets/css/admin-styles.css ) Added an admin CSS file, which currently contains styles for the "Tags Supported" badge (.method-tags-opener)
* ( functions.php ) Added a new function, method_admin_scripts(), that registers admin-styles.css, the jquery ui dialog plugin, and styles for the current version of WordPress-bundled jquery ui for the admin area of the site via admin_enqueue_scripts
* ( functions.php ) Added a new function, method_admin_footer_function(), that injects js and html for the format tags dialog into the admin footer via admin_footer
* ( functions.php ) Added support for inserting em tags to strings processed with the format_tags method.
* ( functions.php ) Added new methods to the layout class for loading a second set of post meta, retrieving loaded meta in a similiar fashion to the get_meta() method, and unloading the meta. This was added for easier handling of meta in archive layout components. ( load_meta(), get_loaded_meta(), get_serialized_loaded_meta(), unload_meta() )
* ( functions.php ) Added a new method to the layout classes, get_loaded_headline(), for indentical headline processing, but with loaded meta.

---

## 1.0.12

Changes:
* ( functions.php ) Added a new function, method_str_replace_assoc(), to find/replace strings using values from an associative array.
* ( functions.php ) Modified markup for the layout class default 'active' component to look like the 404 template.
* ( functions.php ) Added a new function to the layout class, format_tags(), for replacing format tags with html markup.
* ( theme.scss ) Changed body.error404 to .error404 so the contained styles could be reused on non-error404 pages.

---

## 1.0.11

Changes:
* ( assets/images/login-bg.jpg ) Updated the background image for the custom login page.
* ( assets/images/login-logo.* ) Updated the theme logo for the custom login page and changed it's format to SVG.

* ( functions.php ) Added functions to remove post editor options added by Ninja Forms and to lower the priority of Yoast SEO's metabox (if these plugins are used)
* ( functions.php ) Removed granim from the custom login page, and removed it's required extra markup.
* ( inc/granim/ ) Removed granim
* ( login.css ) Added styles for the login page background image, updated the path to the custom logo
* ( login.js ) Removed, as it was only required for granim
* ( screenshot.png ) Updated the screenshot for the theme.
