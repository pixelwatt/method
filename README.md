For extensive documentation on building with Method, check out the [new wiki](https://pixelwatt.github.io/method-wiki/docs/intro).

Method is a base theme designed to facilitate custom theme-building at an accellerated pace, without sacrificing code efficiency or site performance. The theme uses Twitter's Bootstrap 5 framework as the foundation for building the frontend, while using the CMB2 framework on the backend to provide a workflow for programatically creating and configuring metaboxes for custom post editor options and the theme options page. CMB2 offers a wide variety of field types to choose from when building metaboxes, and allows you to create custom field types if needed.

This theme was designed for building fully-customized solutions and is not intended to be a turn-key solution. Especially in reguards to the frontend, Method essentially provides you with a blank slate to efficiently build from. This theme is an optimal fit for projects that heavily utilize custom post meta and theme options (whether through theme mods or custom options), as it is specifically designed to reduce the number of database queries neccessary to utilize such data. Method was originally built to facilitate a workflow where preapproved design comps are converted into a functioning theme.

To get the most out of this theme, it is highly recommended that you use the [Method Generator project](https://github.com/pixelwatt/method-generator) to generate a custom version of this theme compiled to meet your specific needs.
