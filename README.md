# Method Base Theme

![Method Base Theme Banner](https://pixelwatt.com/assets/mbt_banner.jpg)

This is the Method base theme. It's the base theme that I use as the foundation for all Wordpress projects that I build. This theme isn't meant to be a prebuilt, turn-key solution, but a foundation to efficiently build a fully-custom WordPress theme from. CMB2 should be installed alongside this theme. It is used for implementing this theme's options page, and several functions for integrating it with the page editor are included in functions.php.

To get the most out of this theme, it is highly recommended that you use the [Method Generator project](https://github.com/pixelwatt/method-generator) to generate a custom version of this theme compiled to meet your specific needs.
